              HTML & CSS - Standards for the win!
            </h2>
            <p class="skills__paragraph">
              I have a passion for writing semantic HTML and modern CSS. Writing
              clean, short and understandable code with the standards at our
              hands has some serious benefits for various reasons. One of them
              is improving accessibility so that the experiences we create are
              inclusive and take into account people's different abilities.
              Another advantage is that the more standard compliant you are
              working, the less you make yourself dependent on third party
              solutions. Plus, your code is executable on all the major web
              platforms (as you know that is not always the case but we are
              getting there). There are still so many more reasons like SEO,
              maintainability and so on...

            <p class="skills__paragraph">
              For me, designing is about a lot of different aspects of the final
              product. Having aesthetically pleasing visuals, delighting the
              user and guiding him are the key elements that drive my designs.
              Design is not just about how it looks though. To have a satisfying
              user experience, it is important to implement known behavioral
              patterns into the product and to not overburden the user with
              complexity.

              As a frontend designer, I am also keen on implementing my designs
              and make them a reality. For implementation I like to try out
              things to see if they fit my workflow and deliver clean code &
              performance. I have experience in working with Wordpress and
              currently I am trying out Nuxt.js by building this website. Also,
              I am looking more into design systems and am realizing another
              project with Next.js at the moment.

              Being the one that is creating the user experience also means
              making sure that everyone gets to enjoy it no matter his/her/their
              abilities. Creating the most fanciest website has no use if you
              limit the audience that is able to use it. This is why it is
              important to me to use techniques that make sure we don't exclude
              people from digital experiences. Paying attention to contrast,
              writing semantic HTML and making sure the keyboard navigation is
              working as it should are a few things that can already cover a lot
              of the do's there are for creating inclusive experiences but are
              often overlooked.
